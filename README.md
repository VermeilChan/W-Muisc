Version 1.1: The "Better Than Netflix" Update
-----------------------------------------------
Added support for downloading videos in different formats (mp4,mkv,...), now you can watch them offline or on the go.

Improved the GUI by adding a progress bar to show the download progress, it's like a movie trailer, but better.

Fixed a bug where the program was unable to download some videos, no more "Error 404: Video not found"

Improved the error handling to display more informative error messages, no more "Something went wrong"

Added a feature to allow the user to choose the download location, now you can keep all your videos in one place.

Updated the documentation with more information about how to use the program, now it's easier than a kids toy.

In order to run this code, you will need the following requirements:

Python 3.x installed on your system (this code was tested with Python 3.11)
The youtube_dl library, which can be installed using pip by running pip install youtube_dl
The tkinter library, which is included with Python and does not need to be installed separately.

WARNING : Please note that downloading videos from youtube is against their terms of service and it is illegal in many countries.
