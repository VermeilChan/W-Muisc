To use this code in Replit, you can follow these steps:

Create a new Python repl in Replit by clicking the "New repl" button on the main dashboard and selecting "Python" as the language.

Copy the code you provided and paste it into the main.py file in your Replit Python repl.

Save the file by pressing "Ctrl+S" or by clicking the "Save" button in the top left corner of the editor.

In the Replit console, install the "youtube_dl" library by running the command:

`!pip install youtube_dl`

This will install the library in your Replit environment and allow you to use it in your code.

Run the code by clicking the "Run" button in the top middle of the editor or by pressing "Ctrl+Enter".

When prompted, enter the YouTube URL for the video you want to download and press "Enter". The code will then download the audio from the video and save it to the current working directory.

Note that Replit provides a built-in console for you to run your code and view output. If you want to view the downloaded file, you can open a new console by clicking the "New console" button in the bottom middle of the editor and running commands to navigate to the file location and view its contents.
