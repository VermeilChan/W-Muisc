To run this code on Replit, you will need to have the following:

A Replit account: You can sign up for a free account on Replit.com
A Python runtime environment: Replit supports multiple versions of Python, so you will need to choose one that is compatible with your code.
The "youtube_dl" library: This library can be installed by running the command `pip install youtube_dl` in the Replit terminal. This command uses pip, which is a package manager for Python, to download and install the library.
An internet connection: The code makes use of an external API (YouTube) to download the video, so an internet connection is required for it to work.
